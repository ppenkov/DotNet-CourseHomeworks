The first Earth Day was held in the USA. It was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in - a sort of general
educational forum or seminar. That was on April 22, 1970. While this first Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched
by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.

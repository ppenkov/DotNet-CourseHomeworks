Information technology deals with the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information
by a microelectronics-based combination of computing and telecommunications. Thanks to the continuous development of computers, the original
computing systems became minicomputers and later personal computers took the lead. Nowadays, mobile phones are dethroning the personal computer
and computing is evolving faster to become disembodied more like a cloud, becoming accessible more easily whenever needed. Information technology
in this sense has transformed people and companies and has allowed digital technology to influence society and economy alike.

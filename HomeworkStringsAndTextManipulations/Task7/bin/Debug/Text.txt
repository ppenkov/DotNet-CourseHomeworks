Climate encompasses the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and other
meteorological elements in a given region over a long period of time. Climate can be contrasted to weather, which is the present condition of
these same elements and their variations over shorter time periods.Climate may be inherently variable as evidenced by the irregularity of the
seasons from one year to another. This variability is normal and may remain partially understood. It is related to changes in ocean currents,
volcanic eruptions, solar radiation and other components of the climate system. In addition, our climate also has its extremes (such as floods,
droughts, hail, tornadoes and hurricanes), which can be devastating. However, in recent decades, a number of indicators and studies show more and
more evidence of climate warming across the globe. A disturbing phenomenon that challenges human habits and activities which are responsible for 
greenhouse gas emissions.
